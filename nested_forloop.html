    <h2>NESTED LOOP</h2>
    <P> A nested loop in JavaScript is a loop inside another loop. It allows you to iterate over a 
        set of elements multiple times, where each iteration of the outer loop triggers a complete 
        iteration of the inner loop. This creates a "nested" structure where the inner loop is executed 
        repeatedly for each iteration of the outer loop. Nested loops are commonly used when you need to
         perform operations on combinations or permutations of data or when working with multi-dimensional 
         arrays or matrices.</P>

                document.write(b + " " )
